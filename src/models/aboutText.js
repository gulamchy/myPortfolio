      "text": "I’m Gulam Sulaman, a software engineer and full-stack developer currently pursuing my Computer Science graduate studies at Western Washington University. With 3 years of experience at Datacube.ai, I’ve worked on transforming a basic WordPress dashboard into a fully interactive and scalable SaaS platform for B2B clients. My technical expertise includes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and iOS development using Swift, where I build everything from reusable UI components to end-to-end web and mobile applications. I’m particularly passionate about accessibility and inclusive software development, a focus that has deepened through my research in the KIND lab under Dr. Yasmine Eglayly. I enjoy creating solutions that are not only powerful and efficient but also accessible and user-friendly. This drive fuels my work, where I integrate technology with real-world user needs, particularly in accessibility research and machine learning. Outside of academia and research, I apply my skills in entrepreneurial ventures such as Seattle Sayidas, a modest fashion brand. I handle the digital and e-commerce side of the business, leveraging my technical background to grow its online presence. My goal is to continue learning and building software that positively impacts people’s lives."
