      "text": "I was born and raised in the beautiful city of Sylhet, Bangladesh, where my passion for technology first blossomed. After completing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science there, I moved to the USA to pursue my graduate studies. I am currently enrolled in the Master's program in Computer Science at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. I absolutely love the lush greenery, majestic mountains, and the refreshing rain of Washington. Each rainy day here brings back fond memories of home, reminding me of Sylhet’s charm. My career began as a UI designer in 2018, and I’ve had the privilege of working with innovative companies, including Datacube.ai, a business analytics and KPI data visualization. I joined the team as one of the early designers, and it was an exciting experience to help transform their product from a basic template site into a fully interactive and scalable SaaS platform for B2B clients. As I progressed through my academic and design career, surprisingly, my passion for software engineering grew more. This led me to delve into essential tools and technologies. Over time, I have developed strong technical skills in Python, C++, MERN stack development, and iOS development. I am particularly passionate about accessibility and inclusive software development, a focus that has deepened through my research at the KIND lab under the mentorship of Dr. Yasmine Elglaly. I thrive on creating solutions that are not only powerful and efficient but also user-friendly and accessible to everyone. My research involves extensive data processing and deep analysis, which has allowed me to build a solid foundation in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I now enjoy working at the intersection of design, software engineering, and machine learning, where I can innovate and make a real difference. Outside of my professional pursuits, I’m dedicated to giving back to my community. I served as club president during my undergraduate years, and I continue to support others whenever I can. Currently, I provide technical assistance to Seattle Sayidas, a modest clothing brand, helping to empower their mission. In my downtime, I love hiking, watching movies, and spending time with friends."
